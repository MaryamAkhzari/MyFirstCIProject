# MyFirstCIProject

This is my first project exploring Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Learn the basics of setting up a GitHub repository
2. Understand the fundamentals of CI/CD
3. Gain experience with YAML configuration
4. Prepare for implementing automated workflows

Through this project, I aim to improve my skills in modern software development practices and lay the groundwork for more complex CI/CD implementations in the future.
